# ESP32-S3: ProS3 Voice Detection

Using ESP-Skainet on an "Unexpected Maker ProS3" ESP32-S3 development board.

I wanted to play around with machine learning and voice recognition on "the edge" in ESP-Skainet. I only had a ProS3 and an I2S MEMS microphone available.

I am in no way affiliated with Espressif or Unexpected Maker.
